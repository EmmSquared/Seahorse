Seahorse
========

Welcome to the Seahorse initiative. Seahorse is a community research project
with the lofty goal of improving the use and value of data. Seahorse is a
research project to promote and investigate data interoperability and in time
lead to tools and standards to facilitate it.

Seahorse is being progressed as a series of projects. These projects are:

| **Project**                                                      | **Goal**                                                                                       | **Outcome**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Data Lifecycle (Currently in progress)                           | Define a complete Data Lifecycle Model                                                         | A document describing a lifecycle model which is complete (i.e. captures all) elements of the life cycle of any piece ore set of data. -Define a standardised, usable data lifecycle model that is complete and robust enough to cover all situations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Data financial model (Scheduled start Dec ’18)                   | To define an objective model to capture total Data Lifecycle Cost of ownership                 | A document describing and a model to aid calculation of the lifecycle cost and value of any piece of data. Define a standard method to objectively calculate and model the total lifetime cost associated with data Define a standard method to objectively calculate and model the total lifetime value associated with data Define a toolset and methodology to support the data lifecycle cost and value models                                                                                                                                   |
| Interoperability Proof of Concept (POC) (Scheduled start Q1 ’19) | A basic Universal Data Object standard definition and supporting code.                         | Document defining a Universal Data Object (UDO) standard that can address a set of three data types. Necessary open source code to support the above. A recommendation as to the next data types to be added. Create a data interoperability definition to allow a small range of datasets into and out of a unified data standard Build, test and implement an open source tool set to transform data objects into and out of the unified data standard. Be an exemplar for best practices relating to data provenance, provability and robustness. |

Necessary open source code to support the above. A recommendation as to the next data types to be added. Create a data interoperability definition to allow diverse datasets into and out of a unified data standard Build, test and implement an open source tool set to transform data objects into and out of the unified data standard. Be an exemplar for best practices relating to data provenance, provability and robustness.                              |
