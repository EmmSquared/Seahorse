Seahorse
========

Welcome to the Seahorse initiative. Seahorse is a community research project
with the lofty goal of improving the use and value of data. Seahorse is a
research project to promote and investigate data interoperability and in time
lead to tools and standards to facilitate it.

Seahorse is being progressed as a series of projects. These projects are:

| **Project**                             | **Goal**                                                                                       | **Outcome**                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Data Lifecycle                          | Define a complete Data Lifecycle Model                                                         | A document describing a lifecycle model which is complete (i.e. captures all) elements of the life cycle of any piece of data                                                             |
| Data financial model                    | To define an objective model to capture total Data Lifecycle Cost of ownership                 | A document describing and a model to aid calculation of the lifecycle cost and value of any piece of data                                                                                 |
| Interoperability Proof of Concept (POC) | A basic Universal Data Object standard definition and supporting code.                         | Document defining a UDO standard that can address a set of three data types. Necessary open source code to support the above. A recommendation as to the next data types to be added.     |
| UDO definition (V1)                     | Universal Data Object standard definition and supporting code for a defined set of data types. | Document defining a UDO standard that can address a the first set of data types. Necessary open source code to support the above. A recommendation as to the next data types to be added. |
